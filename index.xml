      <description>In ad-hoc data analytics, I often find it useful to return a sequence number along with query results. Once of the easiest ways, if your database supports window functions, is to use the row_number() ranking function
SELECT field_1, ..., field_n, row_number() OVER ( ORDER By order_by_field ) As seq FROM your_table ORDER BY order_by_field  Don&amp;rsquo;t forget to include the final ORDER BY clause if you want your results returned in the sequence.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re into coding or general web development you will have probably thought about creating your own site from scratch at one point or another. If you&amp;rsquo;ve spent hours trying to decide which CMS system to use, hosting provider to trust, and plugins to use, take a step back for a minute. What if you could have a site with no database requirements; high performance on even free hosting; and better still, that was easy to maintain?</description>
